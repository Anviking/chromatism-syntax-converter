# chromatism-syntax-converter
Work in progress attempt to convert highlight.js syntax definitions to [Chromatism](https://github.com/anviking/Chromatism)

## FAQ
### Is this working?
No.
### Have I created something in this language before?
Basically, no.
### Is this a good idea?
In the long turn - no. Currently - maybe. If this can be done good enough for all languages without too much effort it's defenitly worth it.
## How much is it not working?
Currently this is extracting comment and keyword expressions from every highlight.js language, converts them slightly and prints pseudo-code (that wouldn't compile without some modifications).
